# Berkeley-PySeqX
## Team: Kelly Colbert, Yushen Feng, Ethan Lee, Aurelie Metzelard

This repository serves as the working directory for code developed by the UC Berkeley Master of Engineering capstone team on the Illumina HiSeq X sequencer.  Existing work from [this repository](https://github.com/nygctech/PySeq2500) by Kunal Pandit was modified and improved upon to control the HiSeq X bought by the Iain Clark's lab at UC Berkeley.
